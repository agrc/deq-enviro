        <li>The Township/Range/Section checkbox and label are now disabled at the smaller scales when the layer would not be visible on the map.

        <li>Query layer features are no longer displayed when you check them in the "Select Query Layers" pane. The plan is to only show found features on the map after a search is performed (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/26">#26</a>).</li>
