    <h2>0.8.0 <small>Aug 6, 2014</small></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Updated legend labels for the "Indian Country and Tribal Lands" reference layer (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/3">#3</a> & <a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/121">#121</a>).</li>
        <li>Added related tables to identify pane (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/116">#116</a>). Still need to handle nested relationships  (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/127">#127</a>).</li>
        <li>Added a help title popup to the map layers button (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/122">#122</a>).</li>
        <li>Adjusted transparency of result polygons down to 75% (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/124">#124</a>).</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug that was causing strange zooming when searching by address or buffered shapes (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/126">#126</a>).</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug that was causing field aliases with parentheses to not show up in the identify attributes (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/135">#135</a>).</li>
        <li>Fixed a misspelling in the "Hydrologic Units" reference layer label (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/136">#136</a>).</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug that was causing the "There was an error with the search service!" error with certain layers (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/137">#137</a>).</li>
        <li>Fixed a variety of misspellings of field names in the query layers doc (eg. (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/140">#140</a>). Added functionality to the nightly update script to validate field names (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/141">#141</a>). I'm sure that there are more that need to be fixed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.7.0 <small>Jul 28, 2014</small></h2>

        <li>Fixed a bug that was preventing the search graphics from clearing when switching search types (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/3">#3</a> & <a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/114">#114</a>).</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug that was preventing the search by name function to find all features (<a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/3">#3</a> & <a href="https://github.com/agrc/deq-enviro/issues/115">#115</a>).</li>
