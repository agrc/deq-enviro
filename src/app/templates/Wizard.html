                    <p>This step allows you to select specific data layers to search. Your search results will only contain/display data from the layers you have selected.</p>

                    <p>This step allows you to search the data in different ways, but you can ONLY USE one search method at a time.</p>

                    <p>Search by <b>Address</b> allows you to search the data based on a buffer around an address.</p>

                    <p>Search by <b>“City” or “County or Statewide”</b> allows you to search all the data in a specific city, county or the entire state.</p>

                    <p>Search by <b>Site Name</b> allows you to search by the name of the facility, property, water system or other identifier.</p>

                    <p>Search by <b>Program ID</b> allows you to search for program specific identification numbers.</p>

                    <p>Search by <b>Shape</b> allows you to draw your own custom shape to search the data. As the cursor is placed over each shape tool, a brief description of its function appears.</p>

                    <p>This step allows you to review the results of your search. Using the tools in the right sidebar you can start a new search, export results, clear graphics, modify search, or export map images. You can also select individual records to:</p>
